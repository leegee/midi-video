## Completed so far

* An object to render video via ffmpeg.
* An object to interpret  MIDI files using `midi-parser-js`.
* An object to store and render via `jimp` currently sounding notes.
* An object to integrate the above

## Yet to do

* Account for tempo changes.
* Reverse display?
* Optionally scale note height to fill screen based on notes used in supplied file
* Colours per channel/track
* Cache to fs parsed MIDI files
* Note velocity -> size
* Simultaneous notes
